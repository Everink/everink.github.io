So I've been thinking about starting my own blogsite for a while now.
I've some great idea's about how to setup Windows Virtual Desktop, create the golden image for it, and enhance the default configuration.

Knowing myself, when my blog is online, I usually don't bother too much with updating and maitenance. Also as it won't generate a lot of traffic right away I don't want to spend a lot of money on hosting.
So that brings us to the following requirements

- Low maintance
- Low cost
- Simple to setup
- Scalable for if it will be a success

At first wordpress.com seemed like a good choice, untill I found out about Yekyll and github pages.
Github can serve my blog just fine, it's low maintance as it only serves up plain html, and costs nothing!
It's also highly scalable, and it gives me the option to checkin my blogs in source control.

So there you have it. You can find the sourcecode of my website in my [github account.](https://github.com/Everink/everink.github.io)
